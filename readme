hello this is note cli 

note cli is a command line app

that allows people to quickly take notes down and be able to look back at them

at a later date

the notes will be stored on the users computer

and there will be a config file in the .config file of most computers


it will work like this 


get user input from command line
	|
	|
       \|/ 
parse user input 
	|
	|
       \|/
if it is a new note than it will capture the text after the new sign
and make a new note and save that note to the file system
	|
	|
       \|/
else if it is anything else than it will check for (find(path),delete(path),read(path))
	|
	|
       \|/
once the user hits a key the program will shut down
